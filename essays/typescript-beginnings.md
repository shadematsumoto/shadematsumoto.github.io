## Javascript's Younger Cousin: Typescript

Just last week, I explored the world of Javascript and Typescript. I have only experienced languages like Python, C, C++, and Java. Going into Javascript, it was so familiar yet unique in its own ways because of the strange properties of types. It was an uncomfortable experience, but Typescript sure made it feel even more uncomfortable. With its unique type syntax and very flexible type declarations, it reconstructed what I understood of programming and variables.

## How Typescript Changed my Way of Thinking

Typescript really changed how I think about programming variables and what they can store. Typescript has just a few primitive variables that derive from Javascript: number, string, and boolean. These basic primitives were easy enough to understand, but they could be typed in so many different forms. It was hard for me to understand what sort of data they stored, which contrasted my thinking in C where everything is very explicit and clear with how the data is stored. A huge shift in thinking derived from my understanding of multiple types on a single variable. It was confusing to me how a variable could be designed to hold multiple variable types without creating errors as long as you give it any or explicitly multiple types. It was a good way to simplify certain codes that would sometimes return error messages. One main issue however was the lack of error messages in Javascript! Typescript has all the features to fix it, but if you don't explicitly declare variables correctly, there are still various hidden issues that can brew. Overall, I find Typescript to be a very well balanced writing language that provides an effective use for websites when data is organized for understanding rather than efficiency.

## WOD Experience

The Workouts of the Day (WOD) are timed tasks we do in class. They are an interesting approach to training technical skill. The WODs contrasted previous standards of homework and would provide clear examples for students to practice their skills and go through the *action* of creating code. Needing to complete the task within the allotted time was stressful yet invigorating. Going through these exercises would greatly promote my skill in the language and allow me to feel more comfortable writing code, even casually. The stress of timing the WOD provided me with the motivation to get code written and have a part of my brain activate. It's almost like taking a test each time, even with the practice WODs.

## A New Chapter

As I start delving deeper into how to apply Typescript to tasks, I will likely run into roadblocks that will require me to learn the new syntax, rules, or special tools that Typescript provides. With Typescript being my 5th coding language, I find it intuitive yet refreshing for my coding skills. I have faith that the WODs will give me challenging problems that will test my knowledge and guide me to learn more about Typescript.
