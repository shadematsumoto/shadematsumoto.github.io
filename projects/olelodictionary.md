The Olelo Dictionary project is a Java implementation of a dictionary that stores Hawaiian sayings and their English translations made for ICS 311 class. My project utilizes a Red-Black Tree data structure to efficiently manage and search the sayings based on their Hawaiian or English content. It allows for quick access to sayings, their meanings, and provides functionality for finding sayings before or after a given entry in the dictionary.

In addition to basic search features, the dictionary offers specialized methods to search for sayings containing specific Hawaiian words or English keywords. This project showcases the application of advanced data structures to improve performance in handling language-specific data, and also serves as a tool for learning about Hawaiian culture and language.
